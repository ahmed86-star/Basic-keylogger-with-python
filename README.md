# Basic-keylogger-with-python
A keylogger is a type of software that records and captures the keys pressed on a computer keyboard. It can run in the background without the user's knowledge, silently monitoring and logging every keystroke made on the keyboard.

The basic idea behind a keylogger in Python is to use the appropriate libraries or modules to detect and capture keyboard events. These events include when a key is pressed or released.

By utilizing the right modules, you can create a program that listens for these keyboard events and records them. Once the keys are recorded, they can be stored in a file or sent to another location, depending on your desired functionality.
